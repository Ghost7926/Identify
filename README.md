# Identify
This program is a command-line tool for tracking and visualizing the distribution of dice rolls. 
Users can select the type of dice they want to track (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20) and input the results of each roll. 
The program then displays the distribution of the roll outcomes using progress bars, allowing users to analyze the frequency of each result.
